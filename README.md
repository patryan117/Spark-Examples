# Spark-Examples:

# Python Examples
- wordCount_example.py: A basic PySpark map reduce example that returns the frequency of words in a given input string.
- ny_taxi_example: A set of simple map / reduce exercised that show how to manipulate data Spark RDDs.  
- tf-idf_example: A "Term Frequenct — Inverse Data Frequency" KNN Algorithm Search Example for Wikipedia Corpus Inputs
- gradient_descent_example: An example showing different approaches to optimization for simple linear regression.  (examples include series -based calculations, sampled gradient descent, and batch gradient descent.)  

# Scala Examples
- wordCount_example.py: A basic Scala RDD map reduce example that returns the frequency of words in a given input string.
